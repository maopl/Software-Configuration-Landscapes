    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : nx.DiGraph
        The directed graph on which the hill climbing is performed.

    node : int
        The indice of the starting node for the hill climbing search.

        The verbosity level for logging progress, where 0 is silent and higher values increase the verbosity.
